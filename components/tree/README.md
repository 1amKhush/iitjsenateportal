## Data Structure

The tree data is organized in three main layers:

### Layer 1: Main Bodies (3 nodes)
- **ACAC** - Academic Co-Curricular and Activity Council
- **SS** - Student Senate  
- **SAC** - Student Activity Council

### Layer 2: Boards (13 nodes)
- **Under ACAC**: BAI, BDS, BCD, BIE
- **Under SAC**: BCCA, BLA, BAC, BSS, SAA
- **Under SS**: Direct committees

### Layer 3: Clubs & Committees (50+ nodes)
- Various clubs under each board
- Direct committees under Student Senate

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used
- **ReactFlow**: For the interactive flow diagram
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions
- **Lucide React**: For consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling

- Uses ReactFlow for interactive node-link diagrams
- Custom node types with hover effects
- Minimap and controls for navigation
- Click-to-view-details functionality

#### TreeView (Hierarchical)
- Collapsible tree structure
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Color-coded nodes by organization type
- Integrated detail panel

#### SearchableTree
- Real-time search with debouncing
- Dropdown results with type indicators
- Click-to-select functionality
- Mobile-friendly interface

#### SenateStats
- Animated statistics cards
- Gradient backgrounds with icons

- Optimized performance on all devices

## Usage

### Navigation
1. **Search**: Use the search bar to quickly find specific positions or holders
2. **Tree View**: Click arrows to expand/collapse branches, click nodes for details
3. **Flow Diagram**: Pan and zoom with mouse, click nodes for information
4. **Toggle Views**: Switch between tree and flow views using the toggle buttons

### Customization
To add new data or modify the structure:
1. Update `data/treeData.js` with new nodes
2. Maintain the hierarchical relationship using the `parent` field
3. Follow the existing data structure for consistency

## Future Enhancements
